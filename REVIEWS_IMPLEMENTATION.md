## Business Rules Implemented

1. **Delivery Requirement**: Only delivered orders can be reviewed
2. **One Review Per Product**: Users can only review each product once per order
3. **Review Moderation**: Reviews start as "pending" and require approval
4. **User Ownership**: Users can only manage their own reviews
5. **Admin Control**: Admins can moderate and manage all reviews
6. **Data Integrity**: Database constraints prevent invalid reviews

## Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**: All review operations require user authentication
2. **Row Level Security**: Database-level access control
3. **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
4. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against spam
5. **Admin Policies**: Separate policies for admin operations

## Future Enhancements

The schema supports several future enhancements:
- Helpful votes system
- Review images
- Review responses from sellers
- Review analytics and reporting
- Automated review requests via email

## Usage Instructions

### For Customers:
1. Place an order and wait for delivery
2. Once delivered, visit "My Orders" page
3. Click "Review" button for any product in delivered orders
4. Submit rating and optional review text
5. View reviews on product pages

### For Admins:
1. Reviews appear in pending status initially
2. Use admin panel to approve/reject reviews
3. Moderate inappropriate content
4. View review analytics and statistics

## Database Setup

To implement this system, run the following SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Run the reviews_schema.sql file
-- This will create the reviews table, indexes, triggers, and policies
```

## API Testing

All endpoints can be tested using the provided service methods:
- `reviewService.createReview()`
- `reviewService.getProductReviews()`
- `reviewService.getOrderReviewableProducts()`
- etc.

The implementation is fully functional and ready for production use with proper error handling, validation, and security measures in place.
